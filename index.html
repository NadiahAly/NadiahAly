    <h2>A Generative Poem created using Google and Github</h2>
   
    <p1>Pointless to save the past</p1>
    <p1>Accept and pretend he’s still relevant</p1> 
    <p1>Pretend But even that mind game can’t rescue the lazy</p1>
    <p1>The story of man clearly a hapless victim</p1>

  <h3> It starts simply enough:</h3>
  <p2>The proverbial fuse has been lit</p2>
  <p2>waste time</p2>
  <p2>It might be disturbing but people are angry!</p2>
  <p2>go on</p2>
  <p2>The rage bludgeoned into our senses, everything that follows is a mess.</p2> 
  <p2>The threat of tension suggests that some might just deserve it because they’re bad</p2>
  <p2>they fail and are indignant</p2>
 
  <h4>Man wants</h4>
  <p3>they wind up in a series of jams before getting caught</p3>

    <h4>Man deeply offended and  a helpless target</h4>
    <p3>Premise complete.</p3>
    
  <h5>The Man against the hunt facilitated by a ludicrous bit of exposition</h5>
      <p4>Man decries mistreated</p4>
       <p4> grimaces and frowns in disgust at everything around him.</p4>
        <p4>His only emotional note is all ANGRY</p4>
         <p4> it’s horrible.</p4>

  <h6>Should we have expected more?</h6>
    <p1>It’s hard to reveal little insights beyond the redundant tantrums</p5>
     <p1>pretending to have a perfect end to all the living</p5> 
     <p1>in many ways the story of a man provides an excuse to repeat the same idea over and over again, grasping hopelessly for substance.</p5> 
     <p1>because the moment of arrival, in a nearly empty worth</p5>
     <p1>The experience plays less like an attempt to save</p5>
     <p1> Then to burn it all down</p5>
