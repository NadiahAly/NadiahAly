    <h2>A Generative Poem created using Google and Github</h2>
    
    <p>Pointless to Save the past</p>
    <p>accept and pretend he’s still relevant</p> 
    <p>pretend But even that mind game can’t rescue the lazy</p>
    <p>the story of man clearly a hapless victim</p>

 <body>
 
  <h3>It starts simply enough:</h3>
  <p>The proverbial fuse has been lit</p>
  <p>waste time</p>
  <p>It might be disturbing but People are angry!</p>
  <p>go on</p>
  <p>the rage bludgeoned into our senses,everything that follows is a mess.</p> 
  <p>the threat of tension suggests that some might just deserve it because they’re bad</p>
  <p>they fail and are indignant</p>
 
 <body>
  <h3>Man wants</h3>
  <p>they wind up in a series of jams before getting caught</p> 
  
  <h4>Man deeply offended and  a helpless target</h4>
    <p>Premise complete.</p>
    
  <h5>The Man against The hunt facilitated by a ludicrous bit of exposition</h5>
      <p>Man decries mistreated</p>
       <p> grimaces and frowns in disgust at everything around him.</p>
        <p>His only emotional note is all ANGRY</p>
         <p> it’s horrible.</p>
         
  <h6>Should we have expected more?</h6>
    <p>It’s hard to revel little insights beyond the redundant tantrums</p>
     <p>pretending to have a perfect end to all the living</p> 
     <p>in many ways the story of a man provides an excuse to repeat the same idea over and over again, grasping hopelessly for substance.</p> 
     <p>because the moment of arrival, in a nearly empty worth</p>
     <p>The experience plays less like an attempt to save</p>
     <p> Than to burn it all down</p>
